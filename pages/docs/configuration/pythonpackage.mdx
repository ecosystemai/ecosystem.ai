# ecosystem-notebooks Python Package

The ecosystem-notebooks python package provides access to all of the ecosystem.Ai configuration options through a python interface.

## Installation

Install ecosystem.Ai by following either the [Local Installation Guide](/docs/local/) or the cloud [Marketplace App Guide](/docs/marketplace/).

To use ecosystem-notebooks, install it using pip:

```console
   (.venv) $ pip install ecosystem-notebooks
```

Connect to ecosystem.Ai using the url of your ecosystem.Ai server and a valid username and password for your server:

```python
   from prediction import jwt_access
   auth = jwt_access.Authenticate("http://ecosystem-server:3001/api", "ecosystem_username", "ecosystem_password")
```

If everything is set up correctly a ``Login Successful.`` message will be displayed.

## Get Started

The ecosystem-notebooks package provides two main modules: `prediction` and `runtime`. The `prediction` module is used to interact with the server APIs of ecosystem.Ai, while the `runtime` module is used to interact with the runtime APIs of ecosystem.Ai.

Here we'll work through configuring your first deployment using a pretrained H2O.ai model using the server. Pushing the deployment to a runtime instance and testing the response received from the runtime instance.

```python
   #Import the required ecosystem.Ai modules
   from prediction.apis import deployment_management as dm
   from prediction.apis import ecosystem_generation_engine as ge
   from prediction.apis import data_management_engine as dme
   from prediction.apis import online_learning_management as ol
   from prediction.apis import prediction_engine as pe
   from prediction.apis import worker_file_service as fs
   from prediction import jwt_access
   from runtime.apis import predictor_engine as o
   from runtime import access
   import pprint

   #Authenticate with the ecosystem.Ai server

       parameter_access=parameter_access,
       model_configuration=model_configuration,
   )

   #Push deployment and produce properties file
   push_result = ge.process_push(auth_local,deployment_step)
   if "ErrorMessage" in push_result:
       print(push_result["ErrorMessage"])
   else:
       print(push_result["properties"])

   #Test your deployment
   post_invocations_input = {
                               "campaign": deployment_id
                             , "subcampaign": "none"

   offer_response = o.invocations(auth_runtime, post_invocations_input)
   pp.pprint(offer_response)
